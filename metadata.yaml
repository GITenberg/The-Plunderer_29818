description: Bill Matthews heads West with his partner, Dick Townsend, to take charge
  of their mine, the Croix D'Or, but upon their arrival in the mining town of Goldpan,
  they discover that several rivals have been attempting to seize control of the mine.
  Unknown to both owners, Bully Presby, who owns the adjacent property, is tapping
  a low level of the mine and promoting a strike among the miners. After Dick and
  Joan Presby, Bully's daughter, fall in love, however, Joan forces her father to
  confess his plundering, refund the money and leave the Croix D'Or owners in peace.
  Meanwhile, Bill gives his heart to dance hall owner Lily Meredith, who, ashamed
  of her profession, vanishes from the mining camp. Undaunted, Bill departs Goldpan
  determined to find and marry her.
